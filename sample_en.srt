00:00:15,066 --> 00:00:23,583
Well then, first, let's talk about the relationship between Japanese supermarkets and daily life.

00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:38,950
1. The Relationship Between Japanese Supermarkets and Daily Life. Japanese supermarkets are deeply connected to daily life. Many Japanese people go to the supermarket 3 or 4 times a week.

5
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:48,266
This is relatively high compared to the global average. In other countries, people often shop only once or twice a week.

6
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:57,483
Why do Japanese people go to the supermarket so often? It's because they value fresh food.

7
00:00:57,483 --> 00:01:07,733
Also, Japanese homes are small, so there isn't much space to store food. Refrigerators are also small.

8
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:17,633
Japanese people have a habit of buying only what they'll eat that day. They like to use fresh ingredients every day.
